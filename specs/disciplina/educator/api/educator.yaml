      description: >
        Authentication system requires a JWS in Authorization header in `Bearer
        ` format. Example header:

        ```

        Authorization: Bearer
        eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImp3ayI6eyJjcnYiOiJFZDI1NTE5IiwieCI6InFlU3ZrUzZnaW9CcjRlX2I2em8zTWlPT1NYQW90VjkwdDVLajNsMjh5cm8iLCJrdHkiOiJPS1AifX0.eyJwYXRoIjoiL2FwaS9lZHVjYXRvci92MS9zdHVkZW50cyIsInRpbWUiOiIyMDI1LTAxLTAxVDAwOjAwOjAwWiJ9.0_sRvkXTaJTlnLHSjReH70VNFOLx0kdGHDmiDWhUr6H25UCvc5kPD6qn9pDlUwe0uKMpQCGIt_v4hnwWcfVlDA

        ```


        JWS header MUST contain "jwk" parameter ([RFC7515, section
        4.1.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515#section-4.1.3)) with a

        public JWK corresponding to the signature. JWK MUST have key type "OKP"
        and curve type "Ed25519", public key parameter "x"

        should be encoded via base64Url (accordingly to
        [RFC8037](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8037)). Example JWK:

        ```

        { "kty": "OKP", "crv": "Ed25519", "x":
        "2qbm2mPrVVW_yFsHUMzNt3hLdalGLTN8ucI4e-Cn6fI" }

        ```

        This JWK represents a Disciplina public key of an Educator. The whole
        JWS should be created via the Educator's secret key.

        JWS payload MUST be a JSON object with fields "path" and "time". Field
        "path" should contain the endpoint URL path and "time"

        should contain the time the request has been made in
        [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format. Example JWS

        payload:

        ```

        {
          "time": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000000000Z",
          "path": "/api/educator/v1/students"
        }

        ```

        If the request's raw path doesn't match the one in "path" or "time" is
        more than 5 minutes behind the server current time,

        the authentication process will fail.
