\section{Future work}
The current architecture of the Disciplina platform heavily relies on the
fact that a new Educator should gain acceptance from other Educator to join the
network, and ratings of a new Educator are determined by other Educators
accepting it. However, it is possible that other Educators would provide unfair ratings: for example,
they could ignore the existence of private teachers, thus making their
contributions less valuable, or purposefully lower the ratings of competitors
entering the network.

Such problems can be avoided if we carefully integrate the
algorithm of rating computation into our architecture. The ratings would be
based on the on-chain sources of information and provide equal opportunities for
both private teachers and large educational institutions. However, integrating
the rating system into the arhitecture poses several design challenges that we
have to solve.
