\subsection{Data Object Storage}
\label{apx:data-object-storage}

In the section ~\ref{sec:architecture} we supposed that all student's solutions,
papers, assignments and so on are stored locally on the educator's servers. But
it should be possible to introduce the new entity called ``Data Object Storage''
to our model(fig. ~\ref{fig:entities-object-storage}). This entity should support
an encrypted distributed access to all student's works. The main purposes of the
data object storage are:

\begin{itemize}
\item to make publications more accessible for everyone.
\item to get rid educators of the need to store a lot of information locally without loss of security.
\end{itemize}
