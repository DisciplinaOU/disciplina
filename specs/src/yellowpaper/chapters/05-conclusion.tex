\section{Conclusion}
In this paper we presented the architecture of the Disciplina platform. The
described architecture provides a way to store educational records in the
blockchain while preserving the privacy of these records. The concepts of
private chains and a digital CV make it possible to verify the educational
records of a particular person. Educational institutions are connected in a web
of trust to provide credibility for each institution and, consequently, to
digital CVs of their alumni.

We developed our platform not only as the source of trust, but also as a
database of the students from all over the world. We believe that the data that
is stored in the system has a value in itself. The need to disclose this data
was also addressed in the paper: we described a mechanism for the fair data
trade and the measures against the secondary market creation.
