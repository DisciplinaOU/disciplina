\begin{abstract}
In this paper we analyze the main issues that arise from storing educational records in blockchain and propose the architecture of the Disciplina platform -- a domain-specific blockchain implementation. The platform is designed to act as a decentralized ledger, with special regard for privacy and mechanisms of data disclosure. We present an overview of the main entities, their roles and incentives to support the network. Please note that the project is a work-in-progress and the descriptions provided are subject to change.
