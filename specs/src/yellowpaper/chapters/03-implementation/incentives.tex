\subsection{Incentives}

In order to incentivize the Witnesses as well as the Archivists and the Object Store maintainers we propose a monetary policy with two main sources of income. The first one is the technical pool â€” a special pool of tokens, which are reserved until the participants acquire them through contributions to the operation of the platform. The tokens from the technical pool will be distributed with exponential slowdown. Running the nodes for different entities of the system require different hardware resources and there may come a point where the system lacks the nodes of a certain entity. To overcome this issue, the complexity and the amount of tokens received by the participants will be determined dynamically so that the equilibrium between the entities is preserved, for example, if the system lacks the Archivists, the incentive to run the Archivist's node would be more then the one for the Witnesses.

The second source of the participants' income is the fees for the transactions in the system. The Recruiters' fee is distributed among all the participants except the Object Store maintainers. The latter obtain tokens from the Educators paying them for the storage they offer.
