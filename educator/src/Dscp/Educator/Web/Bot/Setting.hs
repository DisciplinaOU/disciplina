-- Constants
---------------------------------------------------------------------

{- [Note examples-in-bot]
We for sure want the bot to contain some entities which later can be used as
examples in documentation, especially in swagger docs. This way developers
can check their work on the spot as well as quickly find which of intermediate
steps causes a bug.

Note that many entities already have hardcoded examples, e.g. `courseEx` and
`assignmentEx` variables, so that one can easily get a sample of a type in ghci.

This tag will be mentioned everywhere where bot includes such an example,
as well as in every case we rely on this bot behaviour.
